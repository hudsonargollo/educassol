Merged non-functional requirements for a comprehensive overview.v1.0: Initial draft focusing on product vision, user personas, strategic goals, and high-level feature requirements.I. Executive Overview & Product Vision1.1. IntroductionThis Product Requirements Document (PRD) provides a comprehensive specification for the design, development, and strategic implementation of the Educassol platform. Educassol is conceived as an intelligent, AI-driven educational content hub engineered to address the specific needs of public primary school teachers in Brazil. This document will serve as the foundational blueprint and single source of truth for all stakeholders, including the development team, product managers, designers, and strategic partners, ensuring alignment with the platform's core objectives and technical requirements.1.2. Problem StatementEducators within Brazil's public primary school system are mandated to implement the Base Nacional Comum Curricular (BNCC), a comprehensive, competency-based educational framework.1 However, they are compelled to do so while navigating a landscape of profound systemic challenges. These professionals operate under severe constraints that fundamentally undermine their capacity to deliver the high-quality education envisioned by the BNCC.The operational environment is frequently characterized by inadequate school infrastructure, with a significant percentage of classrooms deemed unsuitable for learning, lacking proper ventilation, lighting, or even basic furniture.3 This is compounded by overcrowded classrooms and a high student-to-teacher ratio, which limits individualized attention and makes the implementation of diverse pedagogical strategies, such as investigative activities, exceedingly difficult. Furthermore, the profession is marked by significant salary devaluation and a chronic scarcity of financial and material resources, forcing many educators to purchase supplies with their own funds or improvise with limited materials.3This combination of overwork, low wages, and poor working conditions contributes to high rates of professional burnout, depression, and other health-related issues, leading to teacher shortages and high turnover rates.4 The BNCC itself, while a critical step towards educational equity, introduces an additional layer of complexity. Its structure, based on competencies and skills rather than traditional content lists, requires a significant shift in pedagogical planning—a task for which teachers often lack sufficient time and training. The process of finding, vetting, and adapting educational materials to align with specific BNCC alphanumeric skill codes is a time-consuming and arduous task, creating a critical gap between the ambitious requirements of the national curriculum and the practical resources available to the educators on the front lines.1.3. Product VisionThe vision for Educassol is to become the indispensable digital assistant for every public primary school teacher in Brazil. The platform will empower educators to deliver high-quality, engaging, and BNCC-aligned education with significantly reduced effort and time investment. By creating an intelligent, centralized platform that automates the discovery, standardization, and creation of educational resources, Educassol will bridge the gap between curricular requirements and classroom reality, transforming the daily battle of lesson planning into a seamless and creative process.1.4. Strategic Goals & Objectives (Year 1)To realize this vision, the following strategic goals and objectives are established for the first year of operation:Objective 1: Content Foundation: To ethically acquire, meticulously standardize, and securely store a critical mass of 1,000 high-quality educational assets and templates. Every asset will be fully indexed against the BNCC framework for Ensino Fundamental - Anos Iniciais (1st to 5th year), forming the bedrock of the platform's intelligence.Objective 2: Teacher Empowerment: To launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that delivers immediate and tangible value. The MVP will feature an intuitive, BNCC-native search engine and a foundational AI content generator designed for maximum efficiency and ease of use.Objective 3: User Adoption: To achieve an active user base of 5,000 teachers by the end of the first year. Success will be measured not only by user numbers but by demonstrating measurable time savings in their lesson planning workflows, validated through user feedback and platform analytics.Objective 4: Data-Driven Iteration: To establish a robust analytics framework to track user engagement, content effectiveness, search query patterns, and AI generation quality. These data will provide actionable information to guide the product roadmap and ensure continuous improvement.The platform's fundamental value proposition is the reduction of friction in the pedagogical workflow. The challenges faced by teachers—overwork, scarce planning time, and the complexity of the BNCC—represent points of significant friction. Therefore, Educassol is not merely a content repository; it is an efficiency engine. Every feature, from the search algorithm to the AI interface, must be rigorously evaluated against a primary metric: "Does this reduce the cognitive load and time required for a teacher to prepare a BNCC-compliant lesson?" This principle shifts the product focus from simply providing resources to actively simplifying the entire planning process. The AI engine's primary purpose, within this context, is not the generation of novel content for its own sake, but the hyper-efficient production of targeted, standards-aligned materials that directly address a teacher's immediate need.II. User Personas and Scenarios2.1. Primary Persona: "Professora Ana" (The Overburdened Public School Teacher)Role ID: teacherDemographics: Ana is 39 years old, reflecting the average age of teachers in Brazilian public institutions. As is typical for the early years of primary education, she is female, a group that constitutes 88.1% of the teaching staff for anos iniciais. She teaches a 3rd-grade class in a municipal school.Environment: Ana's daily work environment is challenging. She works in a school with precarious physical infrastructure, a common issue in the public system.3 Her classroom is overcrowded, making it difficult to manage diverse learning needs and conduct more dynamic, investigative activities. Access to technology within the school is limited, and the internet connection is often unreliable.Goals:To ensure her students successfully achieve the specific learning objectives defined by the BNCC for their grade level.To find and create engaging and diverse activities, such as games and projects, that foster critical thinking and go beyond rote memorization.To reclaim personal time by significantly reducing the hours spent on lesson planning, allowing her to focus more on direct student interaction and her own well-being.Frustrations (Pain Points):"I spend hours every night searching for activities online, but most are not aligned with the specific BNCC codes I need to cover for next week's lessons. It's like searching for a needle in a haystack."."The official BNCC document is dense and highly theoretical. Translating its abstract 'competencies' and 'skills' into practical, everyday activities that work for 8-year-olds is a constant struggle."."My school provides very few materials. I often have to create worksheets and games from scratch or buy them with my own money, which is already tight.".3"The sheer volume of work is overwhelming. I feel like I'm constantly behind, and it's taking a toll on my health and passion for teaching.".5Backend Permissions:CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on her own generated content (generatedContent).Read-only access to classes she is assigned to.Access to the /api/generate/* API endpoints.2.2. Secondary Persona: "Coordenadora Lúcia" (The School Administrator)Role ID: school_adminRole: Lúcia is responsible for overseeing curriculum implementation for the entire Ensino Fundamental - Anos Iniciais (1st to 5th grade) at her school. Her role is to bridge the gap between policy (BNCC) and practice (classroom teaching).Goals:To ensure that all teachers are consistently following the school's pedagogical plan, which is itself aligned with the BNCC, promoting homogeneity in educational quality.6To effectively support her teaching staff by providing them with high-quality, vetted resources and targeted training, especially for new teachers.To monitor student learning progression against the key competencies and skills outlined in the BNCC across all grade levels.Frustrations:"It's incredibly difficult to ensure a unified and coherent curriculum approach when every teacher is sourcing their own materials from dozens of different websites, each with varying quality and alignment.".6"New teachers, in particular, are often overwhelmed by the BNCC's structure. They struggle to understand how to apply its framework in their day-to-day planning, and I don't have enough time to provide the individual support each one needs.".Backend Permissions:CRUD on users (teachers) within her own schoolId.CRUD on classes within her schoolId.Can assign teachers to classes.Read-only access to all content (generatedContent, contentTemplates) created or relevant to her schoolId.2.3. Tertiary Persona: "Gestor Roberto" (The District Administrator)Role ID: district_adminRole: Roberto manages the educational policies and resource allocation for an entire municipal or regional school district.Goals:To have a high-level overview of curriculum implementation and resource usage across all schools in his district.To standardize the quality of pedagogical resources and templates available to all schools under his administration.To efficiently manage school and administrator accounts within the platform.Backend Permissions:CRUD on schools within his districtId.Can assign school_admin roles to users.CRUD on contentTemplates available to his district.III. System Architecture and Core Features3.1. The BNCC Data Core & Database SchemaThe entire system architecture will be modeled directly on the hierarchical structure of the Base Nacional Comum Curricular.7 A NoSQL/document-based database (e.g., Firestore, MongoDB) is recommended for flexibility with user-generated content. All data will be strictly scoped by schoolId or districtId to ensure multi-tenancy and prevent data leaks.3.1.1. BNCC Hierarchy ImplementationThe database will be structured to represent the explicit hierarchy of the BNCC, enabling multi-level querying and content organization.Level 1: Areas of Knowledge (Áreas do Conhecimento): Linguagens, Matemática, Ciências da Natureza, Ciências Humanas, Ensino Religioso.9Level 2: Curricular Components (Componentes Curriculares): The specific disciplines within each area (e.g., Língua Portuguesa, Arte).Level 3: Thematic Units (Unidades Temáticas): Thematic groupings that provide context.Level 4: Objects of Knowledge (Objetos de Conhecimento): The specific content, concepts, and processes.Level 5: Skills (Habilidades): The most granular level, identified by a unique alphanumeric code (e.g., EF03MA06).3.1.2. Database Collectionsdistricts: Manages educational districts.districtId (string, doc ID), name (string)schools: Manages individual schools.schoolId (string, doc ID), districtId (ref), name (string), adminUserIds (array of refs)users: Manages user accounts and roles.userId (string, doc ID), email (string), name (string), role (enum: district_admin, school_admin, teacher), schoolId (ref)classes: Manages classrooms within schools.classId (string, doc ID), schoolId (ref), grade (string), subject (string), teacherId (ref)contentTemplates: Stores pre-built, curated templates for AI generation. This collection is populated by the Content Acquisition Engine.templateId (string, doc ID), type (enum: activity, project, test), title (string), description (string), gradeLevels (array), subjects (array), promptTemplate (string)generatedContent: Stores all AI-generated materials created by teachers.contentId (string, doc ID), type (enum: lesson_plan, activity), authorId (ref), schoolId (ref), bnccCodes (array), prompt (string), content (Markdown/JSON), createdAt (timestamp)3.2. Content Acquisition & Curation Engine3.2.1. Strategic Shift: From "Scraping" to "Ethical Curation"The project will adopt an "Ethical Curation" model, prioritizing legal compliance, respect for intellectual property, and pedagogical quality. This model is a non-negotiable prerequisite for all content acquisition.3.2.2. Legal & Ethical Curation ProtocolCopyright Law Adherence: All activities must comply with Brazilian Copyright Law (Lei 9.610/98). Unauthorized reproduction is prohibited.robots.txt Compliance: The acquisition engine must programmatically check and obey the robots.txt file of every target domain. For instance, Canva's robots.txt explicitly disallows crawling of template directories, making it an unsuitable source.Licensing First Approach: The primary targets are sources using open licenses like Creative Commons (CC BY, CC BY-SA) or public domain content.Mandatory Attribution: All acquired content must retain clear attribution to the original author and source.3.2.3. Tiered Sourcing StrategyTier 1 (Highest Priority): Open Educational Resource (REA) Platforms: Government-sponsored and non-profit platforms like Plataforma Integrada MEC-RED 10 and Rede Escola Digital 11 are the safest and most valuable sources.Tier 2 (Medium Priority): Reputable Educational Portals: High-quality portals like Nova Escola  produce excellent, BNCC-aligned content. As their content is typically proprietary, the strategy will be a "link-out" model (indexing metadata and linking to the original site) unless a formal partnership is established.Tier 3 (Lowest Priority): General Educational Blogs: Sites like gigiatividades.com  and ieducacao.com  will be manually reviewed by a curation team to serve as inspiration for the contentTemplates collection, without directly copying content.3.3. AI-Powered Content Generator ("Gênio Criador")3.3.1. Core FunctionThe "Gênio Criador" will function as an intelligent "co-pilot" for teachers, augmenting their expertise by automating material creation. It will be a secure wrapper for a powerful large language model (e.g., the Gemini API), with the API key stored securely as a backend environment variable, never exposed to the client.3.3.2. Prompt Strategy & Generation LogicA teacher (teacher role) initiates a request via a dedicated API endpoint (e.g., /api/generate/lesson-plan).The backend validates the user's role and retrieves their schoolId.The system constructs a detailed prompt. If a templateId is provided, it fetches the promptTemplate from the contentTemplates collection and merges it with user inputs (e.g., topic, BNCC code). Otherwise, it uses a standard prompt structure.The backend calls the external AI API with the constructed prompt.Upon a successful response, the AI-generated content is parsed.A new document is created in the generatedContent collection, linking it to the authorId and schoolId, and storing the full prompt and the resulting content.The newly created content object is returned to the user.3.4. API Endpoints (RESTful)All endpoints must be protected by an authentication middleware that verifies the user's JWT and loads their userId and role.4.1. Auth EndpointsPOST /auth/login: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.GET /auth/me: Returns the currently logged-in user's profile.4.2.
